# Covid19-Data-Analysis

# Description
This project explores COVID-19 case trends using Python. It includes full data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to understand patterns such as confirmed cases, recoveries, fatalities, and country-by-country comparisons.
The goal of this project is to practice handling real-world data while developing analytical and visualization skills essential for data science.


# Project Features
-Cleaning and preprocessing large COVID-19 datasets
-Generating country-level summaries
-Visualizing confirmed cases, recovered cases, and deaths
-Identifying trends and patterns across time
-Extracting insights from noisy real-world data
-Using industry-standard Python libraries

# Technologies Used
-Python
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Matplotlib
-Jupyter Notebook / Python Script
