# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization Pipeline

## Description
This project involves the comprehensive collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization of publicly available COVID-19 data. The primary objective was to transform complex statistical data into clear, actionable risk communication designed for non-technical users and local community leaders.
The core goal was to bridge the gap between complex public health statistics and public understanding, demonstrating proficiency in data-driven decision support and human-centered visualization (HCI).

# 🎯 Status: Complete
This project implements a complete pipeline for analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 case trends using Python and the core scientific stack. It includes robust data wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and the generation of informative visualizations.
The primary goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate proficiency in handling large, time-series, real-world data and translating complex statistical metrics (mortality rates, growth curves) into clear, actionable data dashboards. This project showcases strong foundational skills essential for any Data Science or Data Analyst role.

# 💡 Core Analytical & Technical Contributions
This project focuses on the rigorous application of data analysis techniques:
1. Data Wrangling & Resilience: Handled and cleaned large, noisy, real-world time-series datasets. Implemented robust data preprocessing scripts using Pandas and NumPy for date standardization, missing value imputation, and merging multiple data sources.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed comprehensive country-level comparisons. Calculated and analyzed key epidemiological metrics such as Case Fatality Rate (CFR), daily new case growth, and recovery trends to model disease progression patterns.
3. Data Visualization & Metrics: Utilized Matplotlib to construct production-ready charts (e.g., stacked bar charts, time-series line plots, choropleth maps—if applicable). The emphasis was on accurately representing metrics for effective public health monitoring.
4. Systems Thinking & Workflow: Structured the analysis workflow into modular and reusable components within a Jupyter Notebook, ensuring reproducibility and easy extension of the analysis.
